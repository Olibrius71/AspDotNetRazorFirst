# ASP.NET Core Discovery Project
(Started at the end of January 2023)

Made all by myself with ASP.NET Core / C#, Razor Pages, Bootstrap and PostGreSQL and Entity Framework Core for the link to the database.

This project is a movie directory manager that allows you to store movies that you would like to watch: all you have to do is to enter the approximate name of the movie (spelling mistakes won't interfere with its proper functioning) and it will automatically generate the exact name of the movie, its date of release, its plot description and the film's poster (thanks to a Web Scraping library called AngleSharp). It will then save it in the database and redirect you to the display page with all your movies stored
